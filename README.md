# House Rules: Knoxville – Marble City

Welcome to the **House Rules repository** for *Knoxville: Marble City*, a chronicle within One World by Night.

Our chronicle uses the [**Western Shore House Rules**] as our **baseline ruleset**. These provide the shared framework used across multiple games within the Western Shore collective, including Milwaukee, Jefferson, and Chicago. We build upon this foundation with **local clarifications and additions** specific to our setting and player needs.

This repository outlines those local rulings. If a rule or mechanic is not specifically mentioned here, please refer to the **Western Shore House Rules** for guidance.

> **All rules are subject to change at storyteller discretion.** When in doubt, contact staff.

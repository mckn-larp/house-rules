# House Rules: MCKN

---

Welcome to the **House Rules repository** for *Marble City: Knoxville Nights (MCKN)*, a satelite chronicle within One World by Night.

Our chronicle uses the [**Western Shore House Rules**] as our **baseline ruleset**. These provide the shared framework used across multiple games within the Western Shore collective, including Milwaukee, Jefferson, and Chicago. We build upon this foundation with **local clarifications and additions** specific to our setting and player needs.

This repository outlines those local rulings. If a rule or mechanic is not specifically mentioned here, please refer to the **Western Shore House Rules** for guidance.

> **All rules are subject to change at storyteller discretion.** When in doubt, contact staff.

## Signing In

By signing into this game, each participant affirms their understanding and acceptance of all house rules as defined by the MCKN storytelling staff. This includes compliance with OWbN bylaws, organizational policies, and the standards of our local chronicle.

Signing in also serves as confirmation that **both the player and their character are authorized for play** within the One World By Night organization. Characters who have not been formally reviewed, approved, or updated to meet current chronicle or organizational standards may be restricted from play until resolved.

We recognize and allow the use of **proxy characters** — characters played on behalf of another player with their permission. However, all proxies in this chronicle are considered **hard proxies**. This means:

- They are **fully subject to in-character consequences** and the same rules as if the original player were present.
- Signing in as a proxy constitutes **implied consent** to be involved in scenes, actions, or outcomes, including those that may result in injury, loss, or character death.
- The storytelling staff will do their best to represent the absent player’s intent, but **narrative continuity will not be suspended** for characters played via proxy.

By signing in—whether for yourself or as a proxy — you acknowledge your responsibility to engage with the game in good faith, uphold our consent and safety standards, and respect the integrity of the shared story world.

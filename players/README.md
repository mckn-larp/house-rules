# Black Carding: Player Discomfort During Intense Scenes

While our goal is to tell a story that embraces the darker, more challenging elements of the World of Darkness, we understand that there are some topics players may find uncomfortable or distressing.

If such a topic arises, please notify the storyteller. You may ask them to step aside and let them know that the content is something you, as a player, are not comfortable with.

> **At any point in time, a player may leave a scene due to the nature of the content.**

If a player cannot find an in-character reason for their departure, their character may be placed under **"follow mode"** by the storyteller. This means:

- The character remains present under storyteller control.
- If combat occurs, the player will be asked to return to adjudicate their sheet.

If a player does not need to fully leave the scene, but **needs a moment to pause**, they may request a break from the staff. In this case:

- A **10-minute recess** will be called for the scene.
- If the player is still unable to continue after the break, their character will be placed in "follow mode."

In the event of a **PvP (player vs. player)** situation:

- If a player is unable to continue, staff will speak with them privately to understand the concern and assist in resolving it.
- **The 10-minute break or "follow mode" cannot be used to avoid PvP.**

Our chronicle values both immersive storytelling and the well-being of our players. Safety and mutual respect come first.

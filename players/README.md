# Player Policies and the Shared World

Our chronicle thrives on **collaboration, respect, and shared storytelling**. Every scene, every interaction, and every moment of drama is made possible because of the players — and that includes our staff.

This is a **shared environment**, built by the community for the community. Whether you’re a new face or a seasoned veteran, everyone is part of shaping the story. We value your contributions, creativity, and engagement.

> **Staff members are players, too — with an expanded role.**

While staff may guide the story, arbitrate rules, or represent the world beyond your character, they are not infallible authorities. They’re fellow players who have taken on additional responsibilities to help build the best experience possible.

We believe in:
- **Open communication**
- **Mutual respect**
- **Shared accountability**
- **Fair and fun play for all**

This section is dedicated to you, the players — the lifeblood of Knoxville: Marble City. Here you'll find what you need to get started, stay involved, and thrive in our game world.

Let’s tell an unforgettable story — together.

## Code of Conduct
At **Knoxville: Marble City**, we are committed to fostering a **respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment** for all players, staff, and guests. The strength of our chronicle lies in the shared passion we all bring to the World of Darkness — and in the way we treat one another both in and out of character.


## How We Treat Each Other

- We speak and act with **respect**, even in disagreement.
- We assume **good intentions**, not malice.
- We understand that **miscommunications happen**, and we approach them with patience and a willingness to clarify.
- We acknowledge that **everyone is here to have fun**, and that includes you.


## What We Believe

- Every player deserves to feel **safe, welcome, and valued** at our game.
- **In-character conflict** does not excuse **out-of-character hostility**.
- Our community is at its best when we act in the spirit of **collaboration, not competition**.
- **Accountability and forgiveness** both have a place in our culture.


## ❤A Shared Love of the Game

We come together because we love this world, this system, and the stories we create. That love is the foundation we return to when misunderstandings arise.

If problems occur, we encourage players to:

1. Address it **privately and respectfully** if they feel comfortable doing so.
2. Bring it to staff for support and mediation if needed.
3. Work toward resolution — **not escalation** — so that the game continues to be a place of enjoyment for everyone.

Let’s build a chronicle where creativity thrives, friendships grow, and the story is as strong as the community that tells it.

## Black Carding: Player Discomfort During Intense Scenes

While our goal is to tell a story that embraces the darker, more challenging elements of the World of Darkness, we understand that there are some topics players may find uncomfortable or distressing.

If such a topic arises, please notify the storyteller. You may ask them to step aside and let them know that the content is something you, as a player, are not comfortable with.

> **At any point in time, a player may leave a scene due to the nature of the content.**

If a player cannot find an in-character reason for their departure, their character may be placed under **"follow mode"** by the storyteller. This means:

- The character remains present under storyteller control.
- If combat occurs, the player will be asked to return to adjudicate their sheet.

If a player does not need to fully leave the scene, but **needs a moment to pause**, they may request a break from the staff. In this case:

- A **10-minute recess** will be called for the scene.
- If the player is still unable to continue after the break, their character will be placed in "follow mode."

In the event of a **PvP (player vs. player)** situation:

- If a player is unable to continue, staff will speak with them privately to understand the concern and assist in resolving it.
- **The 10-minute break or "follow mode" cannot be used to avoid PvP.**

Our chronicle values both immersive storytelling and the well-being of our players. Safety and mutual respect come first.

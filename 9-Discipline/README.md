# DISCIPLINARY POLICY

[← Back to Chronicle Rules](../README.md)  

-----

**OWBN Knoxville** expects all players — both local and visiting — to abide by the [**Code of Conduct**](http://www.owbn.net/content/code-of-conduct) as written for **One World by Night (OWbN)**.

Any player who wishes to review the Code of Conduct can find it on the OWbN website, and the staff will happily email it to anyone upon request.

## Rules

1. **No arguing with the staff:**
   - If a character’s death depends on a rules call, an aside may be requested.
   - Aggressive actions toward staff regarding rulings will not be tolerated.

2. **Do not endanger other players, staff, or the site.** This includes, but is not limited to:
   - Acrobatics or unsafe physical activity.
   - Bringing live weapons to game.
   - Being intoxicated during game.
   - Use of open flame (excluding lighters) without prior staff approval.

3. **Harassment will not be tolerated**, whether verbal or physical:
   - If a player or storyteller asks you to stop inappropriate out-of-character behavior, do so immediately.
   - In-character harassment must also be moderated. If staff determines that it exceeds acceptable limits, it must be curtailed.

4. **Cheating will not be tolerated.**

5. **Punishments** will be determined by staff based on the situation. Staff reserves the right to escalate directly to more severe penalties when warranted.

## Disciplinary Actions

1. **Warning**
   - A verbal or written notice from staff that a rule has been violated.
   - A warning is simply that — a warning — and will not be held against the player unless the behavior continues.

2. **Strike**
   - Issued if a player's behavior exceeds the bounds of a warning, or if multiple warnings are ignored.
   - A strike will expire after 3 months, provided the player complies with rules and adjusts their behavior.

3. **Temporary Ban**
   - Issued after receiving 3 strikes.
   - Duration: 1–3 games (determined by staff).
   - After the ban period, the player may return, and one strike will be removed from their record.
   - All characters will be **shelved** during the ban.

4. **Indefinite Ban**
   - Player is removed from game indefinitely.
   - Must **petition staff** to return.
   - Characters not GNC’d must be transferred to another chronicle or will remain shelved.

5. **Generate New Character (GNC)**
   - The character is permanently destroyed and may not be played again.

6. **Additional Note**
   - Any punishment beyond a Warning will impact the player’s ability to create **Rare & Unusual (R&U)** characters.

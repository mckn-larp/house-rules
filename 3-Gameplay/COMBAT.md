# Combat Rules & Mechanics

---

## Storyteller Oversight

Once you have signed in, you are under the control of the Storyteller (ST) staff until the end of that game. Unique situations may require this control to extend longer.

## General Combat Rules

- No combat may be initiated within 1 hour of game-off.
- Hard Trait Cap for PCs: 30 (applies in and out of combat).
- All activations must be declared in the presence of a storyteller.

## Buffs

- Only **chronicle-controlled NPCs** may provide buffs to PCs.
- **Retainers** must have an approved sheet on file to be valid sources of buffs.

## Initiative & Turn Order

- Initiative = **Base Traits + Named Traits** from applicable sources.
- Unless a power or effect **explicitly modifies initiative**, it does not apply.

## Combat Order of Operations (Per Round)

1. **Resource Expenditures** (Blood, Willpower, etc.)
   - Majesty activates here.
   - Carrier attacks must be declared/spent before this step.

## Rule of Five

Any game mechanic with a variable trait expenditure is capped at **5 traits max**, unless otherwise specified by a published rule. STs may override this.

## Carrier Attacks

Carrier attacks are:
- Limited to **1 per round**
- Require **trait expenditure prior to attack**

### Listed Carrier Attacks

**Animalism**: Quell the Beast  
**Necromancy**: Mortus Path – Mercy for Seth  
**Quietus**: Scorpion’s Touch *(if traits not pre-spent)*  
**Thanatosis**: Putrefaction, Withering, Necrosis  
**Vicissitude**: Fleshcraft, Bonecraft (as per Tzimisce Packet)  
**Valeren**: Burning Touch *(Not a carrier; requires continued Grapple)*

**Thaumaturgy**:
- Path of Blood: Blood Rage, Cauldron of Blood
- Mastery of the Mortal Shell: Vertigo, Contortion, Seizure, Body Failure
- Vine of Dionysus: Methyskein, Hamaratia
- Neptune’s Might: Blood to Water
- Path of Corruption: Addiction
- Hands of Destruction: Atrophy
- Any Ritual requiring touch

## Additional Defenses

Defenders may spend **1 additional Temporary Willpower** to retest the following powers:

- Chimerstry: Horrid Reality
- Mytherceria: Riddle Phantastique
- Necromancy: Bone Path – Soul Stealing
- Path of the Focused Mind: One Tracked Mind
- Thaumaturgy: Gift of Morpheus – Enchanted Slumber
- Mastery of the Mortal Shell: Body Failure
- Path of Du’at: Consignment to Du’at

## Ties in Challenges

When a trait total tie occurs:
- Each party may add their **permanent levels of one appropriate Ability**.
- Adding traits **only** applies on challenges that tie on trait totals

**Example**:  
Bob (attacker) may add **Brawl**. Tina (defender) may add **Dodge**.

Additional resources for traits in challenge resolution:
- Weapon stats **(limit one item)**
- Specializations **(limit one specialization)**
- Merits
- Disciplines
- Magic Items **(limit one item)**

### Retest Categories:
- **Ability**
- **Supernatural Power(Discipline/Gift/Arcanoi)**
- **Item**
- **Rite/Ritae/Ritual**
- **Merit**
- **Advantage (Tribe, Effect, etc.)**
- **Temper**
> Note, you can only declare and use **one and only one** retest per category.

**Auspex vs. Obfuscate Tie**:  
- Add **levels of Auspex + Investigation** for detection  
- Add **levels of Obfuscate + Stealth** for concealment  
- Each level = +1 Trait
- Combination powers **do not** add levels above the core discipline
> Note that Combination powers **still** gain the benefits of the core discipline so using *See the True Form* (Auspex 2, Protean 4) with Auspex 5 and 5 levels of Investigation would net +10 traits.

If both parties have **"Win on Ties"**, it is treated as if neither has it.

## Bidding Addendum

Unless a power/merit explicitly overrides it, **bidding is capped at twice the generational cap**.

Allowed to exceed the cap:
- Impressive Visage
- Pater Szlachta
- Other ST-approved powers or merits

## Retests

Only **one retest per source** is allowed per challenge. Sources include:
- Ability
- Discipline or Supernatural Power
- Magic Item
- Merit (if allowed more than once)
- Background
- Willpower (if applicable)
- Nature (if applicable)
- Miscellaneous effects
- PvE-specific retest
- Overbid (restarts the challenge entirely)

**Magical effect retests (e.g., Fascination)** can only be used **once per challenge**.

## Mass Combat Rules

These rules outline the structure, etiquette, and mechanical systems in place during large-scale combat scenarios.

## Player Responsibilities During Combat

- **Know your declared number of traits** before throwing a challenge.
- Be able to **explain where your traits come from** if asked by an ST.
- **Know your action** before your turn in initiative.
- Be **prompt** and **avoid unnecessary chatter** during combat.
- **Do not coach other players** on how to run their sheets.
- **Ask rules questions to the ST** only — not to other players.
- **Know your damage output** and its sources. Be able to explain this to an ST.
  - Players may ask STs about **other players’ combat stats** (not directly to other players).

## Armor Hierarchy  
You are allowed 3 types of armor and this is the order the armor levels are utilized when taking damage.

1. Barrier (like a shield bubble around your person, first to take damage)
2. Clothing (Bullet proof vest, padded armor, plate mail)
3. Skin (Anything that adds health levels to your body)

## Challenges & Retests

- You may only have **one retest per category**, unless otherwise noted.

## Damage Reduction (Armor & Similar Effects)

- **Flat damage reduction effects do not function as per book.**
- Instead, they provide **temporary Healthy health levels** equal to the stated reduction value.
  - These health levels **refresh at the beginning of the next round**, unless stated otherwise in house rules.
  - They can be **damaged like normal health levels**.

Any game mechanic with a variable trait expenditure is capped at **5 traits max**, unless otherwise specified by a published rule. STs may override this.

---

## Carrier Attacks

Carrier attacks are:
- Limited to **1 per round**
- Require **trait expenditure prior to attack**

### Listed Carrier Attacks

**Animalism**: Quell the Beast  
**Necromancy**: Mortus Path – Mercy for Seth  
**Quietus**: Scorpion’s Touch *(if traits not pre-spent)*  
**Thanatosis**: Putrefaction, Withering, Necrosis  
**Vicissitude**: Fleshcraft, Bonecraft (as per Tzimisce Packet)  
**Valeren**: Burning Touch *(Not a carrier; requires continued Grapple)*

- Vine of Dionysus: Methyskein, Hamaratia
- Neptune’s Might: Blood to Water
- Path of Corruption: Addiction

---

## Additional Defenses

Defenders may spend **1 additional Temporary Willpower** to retest the following powers:

- Chimerstry: Horrid Reality
- Mytherceria: Riddle Phantastique
- Necromancy: Bone Path – Soul Stealing
- Path of the Focused Mind: One Tracked Mind
- Thaumaturgy: Gift of Morpheus – Enchanted Slumber
- Mastery of the Mortal Shell: Body Failure

---

## Ties in Challenges

When a trait total tie occurs:
- Each party may add their **permanent levels of one appropriate Ability**.

**Example**:  
Bob (attacker) may add **Brawl**. Tina (defender) may add **Dodge**.

Additional resources for tie resolution:
- Weapon stats
- Specializations
- Merits
- Disciplines
- Magic Items

**Auspex vs. Obfuscate Tie**:  
- Add **levels of Auspex + Investigation** for detection  
- Add **levels of Obfuscate + Stealth** for concealment  
- Each level = +1 Trait

If both parties have **"Win on Ties"**, it is treated as if neither has it.

---

## Bidding Addendum

Unless a power/merit explicitly overrides it, **bidding is capped at twice the generational cap**.

Allowed to exceed the cap:
- Impressive Visage
- Pater Szlachta
- Other ST-approved powers or merits

---

## Retests

Only **one retest per source** is allowed per challenge. Sources include:
- Ability
- Discipline or Supernatural Power
- Magic Item
- Merit (if allowed more than once)
- Background
- Willpower (if applicable)
- Nature (if applicable)
- Miscellaneous effects
- PvE-specific retest
- Overbid (restarts the challenge entirely)

**Magical effect retests (e.g., Fascination)** can only be used **once per challenge**.

Let me know if you’d like this broken further into collapsible sections for GitHub or split by phase of combat (e.g., pre-round, resolution, post-round) for even easier use at the table or online.

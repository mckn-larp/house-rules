# Backgrounds, Resources & Systems

-----

## Retainers

Retainers can die. They must have an approved sheet in BE to earn XP.

## Stacking Backgrounds
Use the Laws of Ascension method:

1. Start with the highest rating
2. Add half the value of all other Backgrounds
3. If the total meets or exceeds the highest, raise the total by 1
4. Repeat until no value remains

Example: Resources x3 + (three x2) = Resources x4

### Resources
- Players must have a **Resources card**.
- Must **declare collection** each downtime cycle or at game; no retroactive collection allowed.

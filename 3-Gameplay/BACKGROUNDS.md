# Backgrounds, Resources & Systems

-----

## Retainers

Retainers can die. They must have an approved sheet in Haller to earn XP.

## Stacking Backgrounds

Use the Laws of Ascension method:

1. Start with the highest rating
2. Add half the value of all other Backgrounds
3. If the total meets or exceeds the highest, raise the total by 1
4. Repeat until no value remains

Example: Resources x3 + (three x2) = Resources x4

## Resources

Players track their own Resource cards. Money is distributed per session attended.

| Level | Income |
|-------|--------|
| 0     | $400 and a bus pass |
| 1     | $1,000 |
| 2     | $2,000 |
| 3     | $6,000 |
| 4     | $20,000 |
| 5     | $60,000 |
| 6+    | At ST discretion |

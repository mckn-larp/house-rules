# Item Rules & Crafting Guidelines

-----

This section outlines the policies for item usage, magic item handling, and crafting within the Knoxville: Marble City chronicle. All items must be registered and approved by staff before gameplay.

---

## The 5-Item Rule

You are limited to **5 items per category** at any given time. Items must be recorded on index cards, with **three separate cards** for the following item types:

### 1. Major Items
These create **permanent magical effects** and include:
- Fetishes
- Mage Talismans
- Mage Enchantments
- Vampiric Blood Magic Wards

### 2. Minor Items
These create **one-time magical effects** and include:
- Kyasid Potions
- Incantation Items
- Assamite Poisons
- Talens

> **Note**: A blood bead item card counts as one item. Check with staff for quantity limits.

### 3. Mundane Items
These are non-magical and include:
- Vehicles
- Regular Weapons (e.g., stakes)
- Regular Armor

---

## Magic Items

All magical items must include:
- **Type of magic paradigm used**
- **Caster’s name**
- **Date of casting**
- Any **relevant enchantment details**, such as:
  - Contained spirit type
  - Spirit statistics or additional magical information

---

## Fetishes & Talens

You may not carry more **fetishes or talens** than **half your permanent Willpower**, rounded up.

---

## Weapon Enchantments

Weapons may only be enchanted with a number of rituals **equal to or less than the traits they provide**. This applies to:
- **Temporary** rituals
- **Permanent** rituals

> This rule **does not retroactively affect** existing enchanted items.

---

## Crafting Rules

### Time to Craft
- Crafting takes a number of **days equal to the bonus traits** the item will have.
- **0-trait items** still require **1 full day** to craft.
- Use *Dark Epics* for base stats unless a different source is cited.
- To create a **Craft 5** item, you must have **Craft 5 Ability**.
- If crafting a **modified item**, that project must be your **sole focus** for the downtime cycle.

---

## Modifications

### Required Craft Rating

- **Crafts 3**: You may choose **1 standard modification**.
- **Crafts 4**: You may chop with a Storyteller for a **special modification** or choose an unused standard mod.
- **Crafts 5**: Same as above, but may choose remaining standard mods or chop again.

### Standard Modifications

- Gain a **Bonus Trait**
- Remove a **Negative Trait**
- Deliver or soak **+1 additional damage**
- Adjust **rate of fire** on ranged weapons

---

## Special Modification Chop Results

If you choose to chop with a Storyteller for a **special modification**, the following results apply:

### On a Win
- A **positive modification** is added.
- The Storyteller chooses a benefit appropriate to the item.
  - *Examples*: “High Caliber” (gun), “Shield Break” (sword), etc.

### On a Tie
- You may choose **one of the following**:
  - Gain a Bonus Trait
  - Remove a Negative Trait
  - Deliver/Soak +1 damage  
> Each option may only be chosen **once**.

### On a Loss
- A **negative modification** is added.
- The Storyteller chooses the drawback based on the item.
  - *Examples*: “Loud” (gun), “Fragile” (sword), loss of a health level on armor, etc.

> The player does **not get to choose** the effect in either case.

Let staff know if you'd like help building your item index cards or to check if something falls under a Major, Minor, or Mundane category.

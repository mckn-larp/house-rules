# Item Rules & Crafting Guidelines

---

This section outlines the policies for item usage, magic item handling, and crafting within the Knoxville: Marble City chronicle. All items must be registered and approved by staff before gameplay.

## The 5-Item Rule

You are limited to **5 items per category** at any given time. Items must be recorded on index cards, with **three separate cards** for the following item types:

### 1. Major Items
These create **permanent magical effects** and include:
- Fetishes
- Mage Talismans
- Mage Enchantments
- Vampiric Blood Magic Wards

### 2. Minor Items
These create **one-time magical effects** and include:
- Kyasid Potions
- Incantation Items
- Assamite Poisons
- Talens

> **Note**: A blood bead item card counts as one item. Check with staff for quantity limits.

### 3. Mundane Items
These are non-magical and include:
- Vehicles
- Regular Weapons (e.g., stakes)
- Regular Armor

## Magic Items

All magical items must include:
- **Type of magic paradigm used**
- **Caster’s name**
- **Date of casting**
- Any **relevant enchantment details**, such as:
  - Contained spirit type
  - Spirit statistics or additional magical information

## Fetishes & Talens

You may not carry more **fetishes or talens** than **half your permanent Willpower**, rounded up.

## Weapon Enchantments

Weapons may only be enchanted with a number of rituals **equal to or less than the traits they provide**. This applies to:
- **Temporary** rituals
- **Permanent** rituals

> This rule **does not retroactively affect** existing enchanted items.

## Crafting Rules

### Time to Craft
- Crafting takes a number of **days equal to the bonus traits** the item will have.
- **0-trait items** still require **1 full day** to craft.
- Use *Dark Epics* for base stats unless a different source is cited.
- To create a **Craft 5** item, you must have **Craft 5 Ability**.
- If crafting a **modified item**, that project must be your **sole focus** for the downtime cycle.

## Modifications

### Required Craft Rating

- **Crafts 3**: You may choose **1 standard modification**.
- **Crafts 4**: You may chop with a Storyteller for a **special modification** or choose an unused standard mod.
- **Crafts 5**: Same as above, but may choose remaining standard mods or chop again.

### Standard Modifications

- Gain a **Bonus Trait**
- Remove a **Negative Trait**
- Deliver or soak **+1 additional damage**
- Adjust **rate of fire** on ranged weapons

## Special Modification Chop Results

If you choose to chop with a Storyteller for a **special modification**, the following results apply:

### On a Win
- A **positive modification** is added.
- The Storyteller chooses a benefit appropriate to the item.
  - *Examples*: “High Caliber” (gun), “Shield Break” (sword), etc.

### On a Tie
- You may choose **one of the following**:
  - Gain a Bonus Trait
  - Remove a Negative Trait
  - Deliver/Soak +1 damage  
> Each option may only be chosen **once**.

### On a Loss
- A **negative modification** is added.
- The Storyteller chooses the drawback based on the item.
  - *Examples*: “Loud” (gun), “Fragile” (sword), loss of a health level on armor, etc.

> The player does **not get to choose** the effect in either case.

Let staff know if you'd like help building your item index cards or to check if something falls under a Major, Minor, or Mundane category.

### Defensive
Armor provides its own Health Levels that you mark off its Item Card first when you take damage. When all its Health Levels have been marked off, the armor is too damaged to provide any further benefit. Some armors offer only protection against damage from certain sources, such as firearms or melee weapons.

There are three types of armor:

- Skin (an effect that strengthens your body)
- Apparel (armor you wear)
- Barrier (a mystical barrier like Luna's Armor or Kenetic Shield)

You may have only one effect of each type in place at one time. All mundane armor listed here has the type Apparel, which means you can't wear Chain Mail under a Riot Suit for extra protection -- only one of the two effects will apply, and the other is ignored.

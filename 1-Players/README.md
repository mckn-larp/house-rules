# PLAYER POLICIES AND THE SHARED WORLD

-----

Our chronicle thrives on **collaboration, respect, and shared storytelling**. Every scene, every interaction, and every moment of drama is made possible because of the players — and that includes our staff.

This is a **shared environment**, built by the community for the community. Whether you’re a new face or a seasoned veteran, everyone is part of shaping the story. We value your contributions, creativity, and engagement.

> **Staff members are players, too — with an expanded role.**

While staff may guide the story, arbitrate rules, or represent the world beyond your character, they are not infallible authorities. They’re fellow players who have taken on additional responsibilities to help build the best experience possible.

We believe in:
- **Open communication**
- **Mutual respect**
- **Shared accountability**
- **Fair and fun play for all**

This section is dedicated to you, the players — the lifeblood of MCKN. Here you'll find what you need to get started, stay involved, and thrive in our game world.

Let’s tell an unforgettable story — together.

## Code of Conduct

> Our Code of Conduct is based on and fully supports the organization's code of conduct, available at [OWBN Code of Conduct](https://www.owbn.net/content/code-of-conduct).

At **MCKN**, we are committed to fostering a **respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment** for all players, staff, and guests. The strength of our chronicle lies in the shared passion we all bring to the World of Darkness — and in the way we treat one another both in and out of character.

## How We Treat Each Other

- We speak and act with **respect**, even in disagreement.
- We assume **good intentions**, not malice.
- We understand that **miscommunications happen**, and we approach them with patience and a willingness to clarify.
- We acknowledge that **everyone is here to have fun**, and that includes you.


## What We Believe

- Every player deserves to feel **safe, welcome, and valued** at our game.
- **In-character conflict** does not excuse **out-of-character hostility**.
- Our community is at its best when we act in the spirit of **collaboration, not competition**.
- **Accountability and forgiveness** both have a place in our culture.

## Consent is Key

**Character actions are never more important than real-life people.**

While we play in a *World of Darkness*, and this chronicle explores a wide range of intense and mature themes, we all share the responsibility to ensure that every player feels respected, safe, and comfortable. Individual boundaries vary, and it is the duty of both players and staff to uphold them.

During scenes involving emotionally charged, violent, or controversial subject matter, staff will perform *Check-Ins* with participants to ensure everyone is comfortable with the direction and tone of the roleplay. Likewise, in moments of PvP (Player vs. Player) conflict or distressing interactions, players may be asked to adjust the nature of their actions if they are making others uncomfortable. This is not about removing consequences—it’s about adapting them to keep the game safe, fun, and immersive for all.


### Withdrawing Consent from a Scene

At any time, a player may **withdraw their consent** from a scene, interaction, or environment they no longer wish to be part of. No justification is required. If this occurs:

- **The player will be allowed to step out immediately.**
- **Storytellers will determine the results for the character**, including how they exit the scene and what consequences (if any) follow.

These outcomes may include:

- The character being placed under “follow mode” (present but directed by STs).
- Scene adjustments or retcons that preserve player well-being while keeping narrative flow.
- Application of realistic consequences — **including injury, disappearance, or character death** — if such outcomes are appropriate for the in-game circumstances.

Storytellers will always consider the narrative, context, and character history—but stepping away from a scene does **not** protect a character from logical danger. The world continues, even if the player must step away.

This policy is **non-negotiable**. Player safety comes first. The Storytellers are empowered to make decisions that preserve that safety while maintaining continuity for everyone else at the table.


### This Is Not a Way to Avoid Consequences

This is **not** a loophole to avoid danger, escape conflict, or "pause" the game. It is a **creative fail-safe** that ensures we tell collaborative, respectful stories that adapt to real-life needs.

- If you’re uncomfortable with a theme, we’ll find another path.
- If a situation is too intense, we’ll handle it discreetly.
- If you step away from the story, it doesn’t freeze around your absence.

Consequences will still exist. They may simply be handled differently, behind the scenes, or off-camera. No one gets a free pass, but no one gets punished for caring for themselves, either.

### Death Tax: When a Character Is Removed from Play

Our game encourages deep roleplay and long-term storytelling. Removing another player’s character from the game—whether by death, banishment, or permanent harm—should be a **last resort**, not a shortcut to solve a conflict.

As such, any time a **player character permanently removes another player character** from play, a **Death Tax** may be applied:

- The aggressor may lose **0% t0 25% of the XP total of the character they removed**, depending on circumstances and ST judgment.
- This may include **XP deduction**, **loss of items, powers, or Influence**, or other narrative setbacks.
- This applies to **death**, **banishment**, **permanent incapacitation**, or any similar outcome that makes a character unplayable in this game.

The tax is based on:

- The aggressor’s **in-character justification** for the action.
- The **effort made to resolve the issue through roleplay** before reaching for violence.
- The **tone and conduct of the scene** (i.e., was it dramatic storytelling or out-of-game frustration?).

**This policy exists to protect characters as story assets, not invulnerability.** Sometimes a character must die—but it should mean something.

### TL;DR

- Players may leave a scene at any time.
- Storytellers will resolve the results for the character—and those results **may include death**.
- Players who remove other characters from play may be taxed XP or resources depending on the circumstances.
- The goal is always immersive consequence, not mechanical punishment.
- Player safety comes first. The story comes next.

Everyone deserves a game where they feel **welcome, valued, and safe**—even while playing monsters. We build that environment together, with care, flexibility, and respect for both the story and each other.

## Characters & You: Shared Ownership in a Shared World

At MCKN, your character is more than just a sheet — it's a narrative contribution to something larger than yourself. We believe that characters are **co-owned by the player and the chronicle**, with both parties sharing responsibility in how those characters live, grow, and sometimes fall within the story.

### Shared Stewardship

When you bring a character to life in our chronicle, you retain ownership of your concept, voice, and personal creativity. However, by joining MCKN, you grant the chronicle a shared role in developing, interpreting, and progressing that character within the context of our shared world.

- Players **own** their characters’ backgrounds, personalities, motivations, and development arcs.
- The Chronicle **stewards** those characters within a living setting — one that evolves, challenges, and occasionally changes them.

This agreement isn't about control — it's about cooperation. We build this together.

### What Shared Ownership Means

- Characters can be referenced, involved in plots, or affected by events while players are away.
- Staff may retcon, advance, or resolve scenes in a character’s absence to preserve game continuity.
- Significant changes will always consider the character’s context, prior history, and the player's intent — but the game world keeps moving.

When you create a character here, you grant the chronicle a **non-exclusive license** to include them in stories, scenes, and consequences that serve the broader narrative.

### Rails, Not Walls

Shared ownership does not mean unchecked freedom. The following principles apply to players and staff alike:

- Players cannot use out-of-character tools to shield characters from earned consequences.
- Staff cannot use narrative authority to override player agency without clear justification.
- Consequences, growth, and change are all part of meaningful storytelling.

If you step away from a scene, the story doesn't pause. Your character may continue under storyteller guidance, and outcomes will be determined fairly based on context.

### Protecting the Spirit of the Game

To prevent misuse of safety systems or narrative authority:

- **Timeouts and content withdrawals** are honored without question for real-life safety, but do not shield characters from in-game ramifications.
- **Storytellers apply realistic outcomes**, from subtle changes to character death, always grounded in the story.
- **Players are not punished** for caring for their own well-being — but neither are characters granted immunity from the consequences of the world.

This isn’t about mechanical punishment — it’s about narrative integrity.

### The Bottom Line

- Characters belong to both the player and the chronicle.
- Storytelling rights are shared, and responsibility is mutual.
- Staff and players alike are stewards of the narrative.
- All actions carry consequence — in-character and out.
- Everyone is here to have fun, feel safe, and tell powerful stories.

By participating in MCKN, you agree to this shared model — one that balances **respect for your character** with **respect for the game as a whole**. It’s how we tell lasting stories, together.

## A Shared Love of the Game

We come together because we love this world, this system, and the stories we create. That love is the foundation we return to when misunderstandings arise.

If problems occur, we encourage players to:

1. Address it **privately and respectfully** if they feel comfortable doing so.
2. Bring it to staff for support and mediation if needed.
3. Work toward resolution — **not escalation** — so that the game continues to be a place of enjoyment for everyone.

Let’s build a chronicle where creativity thrives, friendships grow, and the story is as strong as the community that tells it.

## Black Carding: Player Discomfort During Intense Scenes

While our goal is to tell a story that embraces the darker, more challenging elements of the World of Darkness, we understand that there are some topics players may find uncomfortable or distressing.

If such a topic arises, please notify the storyteller. You may ask them to step aside and let them know that the content is something you, as a player, are not comfortable with.

> **At any point in time, a player may leave a scene due to the nature of the content.**

If a player cannot find an in-character reason for their departure, their character may be placed under **"follow mode"** by the storyteller. This means:

- The character remains present under storyteller control.
- If combat occurs, the player will be asked to return to adjudicate their sheet.

If a player does not need to fully leave the scene, but **needs a moment to pause**, they may request a break from the staff. In this case:

- A **10-minute recess** will be called for the scene.
- If the player is still unable to continue after the break, their character will be placed in "follow mode."

In the event of a **PvP (player vs. player)** situation:

- If a player is unable to continue, staff will speak with them privately to understand the concern and assist in resolving it.
- **The 10-minute break or "follow mode" cannot be used to avoid PvP.**

Our chronicle values both immersive storytelling and the well-being of our players. Safety and mutual respect come first.

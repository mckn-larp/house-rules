# Renown & Rank

---

This section explains how characters progress in Rank, how Renown is handled, and how to track your eligibility over time.

## Rank Progression

Characters advance in rank based on a combination of **total experience (XP)** and **real-world time** since their characterâ€™s creation or their **last completed rank challenge**.

> Time requirements begin from:
> - The day you **create** your character **or**
> - The day you **complete your last rank challenge**

You **must email staff** to notify them of the date your **last rank challenge** was completed.

### Advancement Requirements

- **Rank Transition:** Total XP Required, Time Required since last increase, Notes

- **Rank 0 -> Rank 1:** 25 XP, 1 month, Requires Den Parent permission
- **Rank 1 -> Rank 2:** 75 XP, 3 months
- **Rank 2 -> Rank 3:** 125 XP, 6 months
- **Rank 3 -> Rank 4:** 175 XP, 9 months
- **Rank 4 -> Rank 5:** 300 XP, 1 year

> **See the Punishment Rites** section for any modifications to XP or time requirements.

## Rank Challenges

- All **Changing Breeds** must go through the **appropriate challenge process** (e.g., Rank Challenge, Court of Autumn, Parliament).
- Eligibility must be **confirmed by staff** before proceeding with the rank-up method.
- If no official method exists for your next rank, **work with staff** to determine your path forward.

## Renown Tracking

Because we use a **Time/XP-based system**, your Renown is assumed to be:

- The **minimum required** for your current rank, as listed in *Laws of the Wild Revised (pg. 181)*.
- **Ragabash**: Your Renown is **evenly split** between categories unless tracked/logged otherwise with the ST staff.

If your character possesses **Gifts or Powers that rely on Renown numbers**, please **discuss with the STs privately** to establish accurate totals.

## Rank Benefits

> **We do not use any form of Rank-based mechanical benefits.**  
> Rank is narrative and prestige-based only.

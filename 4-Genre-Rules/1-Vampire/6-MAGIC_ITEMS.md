While mortal, the character will age as if he had never died.

#### Damascene Blades
- **Type:** VA
- **Level:** N/A
- **Effect:** Damascene blades imbued with magic are potent primarily because of their swiftness, their strength is not that much greater than that of regular Damascus steel.  A magical Damascene blade allows for an extra attack automatically in each round of combat, and when used with Celerity such a blade can be devastating.  Additionally, these swords are so lightning-fast that they may actually knock arrows out of the air.  Instead of using the Dodge ability to retest against archery challenges, the wielder of this blade may use the Melee ability instead.  Furthermore, the blades are somehow aware of such cowardly attacks and will spring into their wielder’s hands by themselves, so that a missile attack never surprises one blessed enough to hold a magical Damascene sword.

- **Level:** N/A
- **Effect:** This unholy article of clothing is a priestly vestment with a Sabbat blessing and curse upon it. The curse dooms the owner to lose any loved one who touches the robe. The blessing allows the vampire to use Necromancy (Sepulchre Path) up to level four. The necromantic powers of the robe are not compatible with any Necromancy the vampire may already have.

#### Ashes
- **Type:** VA
- **Level:** N/A
- **Effect:** Ashes of the Ancients are useless in and of themselves, unless one seeks to melt the snow on one’s walk.  To use the ashes, the Cainite possessing them must anoint his body with the ashes.  Anointing the appropriate body part with the ash increases on Attribute by two for as long as the ash remains unblemished.  For example, placing ash on one’s eyelids would increase Perception by two, while marking one’s feet would increase Dexterity.

#### Weylan’s Wycran
- **Type:** VA
- **Level:** N/A
- **Effect:** A Wayland-forged blade is, first and foremost, indestructible by anything short of the blood of dragons or other similar potent monsters.  The blade will never notch or break, even when crossed with another of the same lineage.  The gems set into the hilt cannot be pried loose, and any gold worked into the inlay cannot be melted out or otherwise extracted.  These weapons were made for skilled swordsmen and they will not suffer themselves to be wielded by unworthy masters.  If grasped by a character without at least two levels in Melee, steel thorns will sprout from the grip of the blade, piercing the offending hand and causing two levels of aggravated damage.  Two points worth of blood will also be absorbed into the blade at this time; if a Cainite is pierced thus and attempts to heal himself while still impaled by on the thorns, any blood directed toward healing will instead be drunk by the thirsty blade.  In the hands of a worthy swordsman, however, a blade from Wayland’s forge is little short of miraculous.  It adds two bonus traits to the weapon and two additional levels of damage.  It can also break blades that cross it with a standard Physical challenge retested with Melee.  Furthermore, many of these blades sing or chant in battle, and the knowledge that a Wayland-forged sword is on the field has broken several armies ranks.  Wayland’s swords, by drinking from the hands that wield them, have a limited blood pool (five points) and access to something mimics Celerity (granting 1 additional action a round for one blood trait from the sword).  At storyteller’s discretion, the sword will use its Blood Pool and take extra actions of its own initiative.  When a sword’s Blood Pool reaches zero, it immediately sprouts thorns and begins to drink.  Swords that drink thrice from the same Cainite can develop a Blood Oath for that vampire, and legends speak of bereaved swords that seek lost masters across Europe.  It is worth noting that none of Wayland’s swords has ever been proved to be truly aware.  They have hungers and a certain sort of instinct, but nothing more.  By way of an explanation for this phenomenon, Certain Cappadocians claim that Wayland has hammered souls into each of his pieces.  This lends credence to the idea that Wayland and the Great Smith of the Dead are the same.  Other scholars scoff at this, but mumble of fae magics and their ilf.

#### Blood Pouch
- **Type:** VA
- **Level:** N/A
- **Effect:** Some Kindred feel Blood Pouches have been superseded by modem methods of cold storage, but vampires still find them valuable.

# Blood Magic Rules & Clarifications

Characters are allowed to learn **multiple styles of Blood Magic**, but these must follow a strict hierarchy of mastery.

---

## Style Hierarchy

- Your **first style** is considered your **primary paradigm**.
- Any **secondary style** cannot exceed the mastery of your primary.
- A **tertiary style** cannot exceed the mastery of your secondary, and so on.

### Example Progression:

**Primary Style:**
- 2 Paths at Advanced
- 1 at Intermediate, 1 at Basic
- 10 Basic Rituals, 5 Intermediate, 3 Advanced

**Secondary Style:**
- 1 Path at Advanced, 1 at Intermediate, 1 at Basic
- 9 Basic Rituals, 4 Intermediate, 2 Advanced

**Tertiary Style:**
- 1 Path at Intermediate, 1 at Basic
- 8 Basic Rituals, 3 Intermediate

## Ritual Casting

- At sign-in, characters may pre-cast a number of rituals equal to their **Occult rating** without needing to throw challenges.
- Any **additional rituals** cast at game require **downtime equal to half the listed casting time**.
- **Exception**: Rituals that take over an hour still require the full time listed.

## Style-Specific Clarifications

### Necromancy

**Ash Path: Ex Nihilio**
- Test difficulty equals **Shroud Rating**.

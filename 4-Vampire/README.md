This section outlines the specific process for creating **Sabbat Vampire characters** in the *Knoxville: Marble City* chronicle. It replaces and updates prior Vampire-specific creation sections and brings Sabbat-specific systems in line with current play guidelines and OWBN approval processes.

   See the list below for approved Sabbat Clans.

2. **Choose a Sabbat Faction**

   These represent your character’s internal drive and outward behavior.

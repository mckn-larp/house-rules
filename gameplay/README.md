# Gameplay: Rules Reference and Notes

## Source Material

If there is a question not covered in these house rules, please refer to the appropriate **Mind’s Eye Theatre** book. The **most thematically or mechanically appropriate book** should take precedence.

Recommended sources include:

- **Dark Epics**
- **Faction Books** (Clan, Tribe, Kith, Tradition, etc.)

## Storyteller Oversight

Once you have signed in, you are **under the control of the Storyteller (ST) staff** until the end of that game. Unique situations may require this control to extend longer.

---

## Refresh/Feeding Challenges

At check-in, a **feeding or refresh challenge** may be required at ST discretion.  
- **Retest**: Use the appropriate ability or background: **Hunting, Meditation, etc.**  
- If your character has special restrictions related to feeding or refresh (e.g., *Conspicuous Consumption*, *Allergies*, *Feeding Grounds*, or is a *Ventrue*), please notify staff.

> Anything beyond or instead of the appropriate ability will require a scene.

# Gameplay: Rules Reference and Notes

## Source Material

If there is a question not covered in these house rules, please refer to the appropriate **Mind’s Eye Theatre** book. The **most thematically or mechanically appropriate book** should take precedence.

Recommended sources include:

- **Dark Epics**
- **Faction Books** (Clan, Tribe, Kith, Tradition, etc.)

---

## Storyteller Oversight

Once you have signed in, you are **under the control of the Storyteller (ST) staff** until the end of that game. Unique situations may require this control to extend longer.

---

## Refresh/Feeding Challenges

At check-in, a **feeding or refresh challenge** may be required at ST discretion.  
- **Retest**: Use the appropriate ability or background: **Hunting, Meditation, etc.**  
- If your character has special restrictions related to feeding or refresh (e.g., *Conspicuous Consumption*, *Allergies*, *Feeding Grounds*, or is a *Ventrue*), please notify staff.

> Anything beyond or instead of the appropriate ability will require a scene.

---

## Combat Guidelines

## Retainers Can Die

Retainers are subject to the same risks as PCs. If they are destroyed, they are lost. Make sure your retainer has an approved sheet (via Haller) to be eligible for XP and in-play activity.

---

## Stacking Backgrounds  
*As per Laws of Ascension*

When multiple characters combine Backgrounds (like **Resources** or **Influence**) for a shared goal, they do **not stack directly**. Instead, use the following method for calculating combined value:

1. Take the **highest single Background rating**.
2. Add **half of the other Backgrounds' values** (rounded down).
3. If the sum equals or exceeds the original high value, increase the total by +1.
4. Repeat as needed until no value remains to add.

**Example**:  
A character with **Resources x3** wants to simulate **Resources x4**. They would need:
- Three characters with **Resources x2** (total = 6, halved = 3)
- Or two others with **Resources x3**

> **Note**: Influence stacking is still limited by the character’s total number of **Attribute Traits**. Donated Influence counts toward this limit.

---

## Resources

Each player is responsible for tracking their **Resource card(s)**. At each attended session in a Western Shore game, the ST will add your session’s "spending money" to the card. This applies across all Western Shore games (Milwaukee, Jefferson, Chicago, etc.).

### Resource Income by Level:
- **Level 0**: $400 and a bus pass
- **Level 1**: $1,000
- **Level 2**: $2,000
- **Level 3**: $6,000
- **Level 4**: $20,000
- **Level 5**: $60,000
- **Level 6+**: At ST discretion

Resources may be awarded retroactively with storyteller approval.

---

## Haven

In order to benefit from the **Haven** background:
- The haven must be a **private location**, not public.
- A **write-up must be submitted** to staff.

### Haven Levels:
- **Haven 1**: One un-cancelable retest per session.
- **Haven 2**: +1 Trait in any challenge (stacks and exceeds cap).
- **Haven 3**: One more un-cancelable retest per session (total: 2).
- **Haven 4**: +1 additional Trait in any challenge (total +2).
- **Haven 5**: One more un-cancelable retest per session (total: 3).

Additional actions may be submitted to improve the Haven’s effectiveness or security.

---

## Influences

Handled as per **Dark Epics**, with stacking rules listed above under Backgrounds.

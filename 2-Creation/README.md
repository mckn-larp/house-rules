## General Creation Rules

## Nature & Demeanor

#### General Rules
Your Nature is who you truly are, the essence of your self. Your Demeanor is how you present yourself to others. Both come from the same list.

### Nature & Demeanor List
These are not all possible Natures and Demeanors; just about any one- or two-word phrase describing a character archetype can be used as a Nature or Demeanor if you don't find anything here that suits you.

- *Architect*: You mean to build something with your life that will have value beyond your years.
- *Autist*: You hide truths about yourself from others, preferring to maintain secrecy.
- *Autocrat*: Power is its own reward, and you mean to be rewarded.
- *Avant-Garde*: You want to break new ground and set the trends others will follow.
- *Bon Vivant*: You live life large, always on the lookout for a good time.
- *Bravo*: Others call you a bully, the crybabies. You just like to be respected. Or feared.
- *Caregiver*: You suffer alongside the suffering of others, and reach out to care for them.
- *Child*: You haven't really grown up yet. You need someone to look out for you.
- *Competitor*: You're the best, and you're going to prove it. Life's a game to be won.
- *Confidant*: You want people to talk to you. You're ready to listen to their feelings and secrets.

- *Conniver*: Why do the work when you can get someone else to do it for you.
- *Critic*: You mean to improve the world by pointing out all its failings.
- *Curmudgeon*: You've seen it all, and that has made you a cynic.
- *Deviant*: There's something truly bizarre about you. You've never fit in and never will.
- *Director*: Leading others is second nature to you. You organize and achieve.
- *Fanatic*: Nobody's as dedicated to the cause as you are. You'll do anything in its name.
- *Gallant*: You enjoy being the showoff at the center of attention. You need their praise to feel good.
- *Jester*: Whether you love making people laugh or you're just masking your pain, you're always making a joke.
- *Jobsworth*: You establish efficient procedures and then stick to them. It's all part of doing the job.
- *Judge*: You express strong opinions about right and wrong, impartial of your own situation.
- *Loner*: You don't need anyone to get by. You don't even really want the company.
- *Martyr*: To sacrifice oneself for others is the highest good, and you mean to give everything up.
- *Masochist*: Your own suffering drives and inspires you. Pain and struggle leads to greater insights.
- *Optimist*: In a world full of darkness, you still believe there is good to be found.
- *Penitent*: What you've done is unforgivable. All you can do now is try to atone.
- *Perfectionist*: Your standards are as high as they come, and you mean to live up to them.
- *Poltroon*: Danger and pain and hardship? Not your thing. All you want to do is avoid trouble.
- *Rebel*: The status is not quo! You kick tradition in the shins and blaze your own trail.
- *Scientist*: Knowledge is power, and everything can be understood with enough discipline.
- *Survivor*: The world has tried to beat you down, but you keep hanging on. You're in this for you.
- *Sycophant*: You need someone bigger and stronger than you to tell you you're worthy.
- *Traditionalist*: The status is quo. You uphold the traditions, time-tested by your ancestors.
- *Visionary*: You aspire to a higher calling that's sometimes difficult to express.

### Regaining Willpower with your Nature
If you are low on unspent Willpower Traits and you role-play in a way you feel uniquely satisfies your Nature, inform a Storyteller. The Storyteller may opt to give you simple Rock-Paper-Scissors throw. On a win or a tie, you earn back one Willpower Trait. Alternatively, the Storyteller can opt to reward you one Willpower trait without requiring a challenge for particularly good demonstration of roleplaying your character's Nature. This may only be done once per Scene.

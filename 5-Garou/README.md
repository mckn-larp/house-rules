## Character Creation Steps

1. **Choose Breed, Auspice, and Tribe**  
   Your character’s supernatural nature is shaped by their **Breed** (Homid, Metis, Lupus), **Auspice** (moon phase at birth), and **Tribe** (Garou nation affiliation). These determine your allowed starting Gifts and may influence social expectations and spiritual outlook.

2. **Choose a Nature and Demeanor**  
   These reflect your character’s internal motivation and outward behavior. They determine how your character regains **Willpower**.

3. **Choose a Rank**  
   - **Cliath (Rank 1)** is available at no cost.
   - **Fostern (Rank 2)** requires Storyteller approval and a background.  
     - Cost: **2 points per dot of Permanent Renown** required.  
     - Starting Permanent Renown may not exceed what is required for Rank 2 at creation.

4. **Assign Traits (Physical, Social, Mental)**  
   Initially, you receive 7/5/3 traits. Additional traits cost **1 point each**, with no distinctions between categories.  
   - Maximum of 5 per category without special approval.  
   - Players are responsible for ensuring their spread is reasonable and thematic to the concept.

5. **Choose Abilities**  
   Abilities (such as Brawl, Survival, Rituals, Empathy, Leadership, etc.) cost **1 point each**.  
   - There is no hard limit, but characters should not start with any Ability above 3 dots without background justification.

6. **Assign Tempers: Rage, Gnosis, Willpower**  
   - You receive the following for free:
     - **Rage:** 1  
     - **Willpower:** 1  
     - **Gnosis:** 2  
   - Your **Breed**, **Auspice**, and **Tribe** may adjust these values.  
   - Additional dots in each cost **3 points per dot**.  
   - Your total in these may not exceed your caps (as per MET/W20 standards).

7. **Choose Gifts**  
   - You may choose **Basic-level Gifts** only at creation.  
   - Gifts from your **Breed**, **Auspice**, and **Tribe** are available.  
   - Each Gift costs **3 points**.  
   - All Gifts must be chosen from the **approved list**.  
   - You are not limited to 3 Gifts; you may spend points freely, but all must be Basic level.

8. **Assign Backgrounds**  
   - Backgrounds cost **1 point per dot**.  
   - Up to 14 dots are allowed at creation.  
   - Backgrounds **must be justified** in your submitted backstory (due within 90 days).  
     - If not submitted in time, spent points will be removed.

9. **Apply Breed, Auspice, and Tribe Advantages**  
   Any approved traits, restrictions, or bonuses from Breed, Auspice, and Tribe should now be recorded. These may affect maximums, Gift access, or character expectations.

10. **Assign Renown**  
   - Cliath characters start with 3 Temporary Renown, distributed appropriately.  
   - Additional Temp Renown may be acquired, with ST approval.  
   - Permanent Renown must be purchased to meet your Rank’s requirement, if starting above Rank 1, at **2 points per dot**.

11. **Choose Flaws and Negative Traits**  
   - Take up to **7 points of Flaws** to gain an equal number of bonus points.  
   - You may also select up to **5 Negative Traits**, each granting **1 bonus point**.  
   - Flaws and Negative Traits must make sense for the concept.

12. **Gain Additional Bonuses**  
   - You receive **5 Freebie Points**.  
   - You also gain **30 Starting XP** to spend on further development.  
   - XP may be spent using standard OWbN XP costs.

13. **Finalize Sheet and Submit**  
   - Submit your complete character sheet and background within **90 days** detailed below.  
   - After that time, no mechanical changes are permitted without ST approval.

- **Tempers (Rage, Gnosis, Willpower)** cost **3 points per dot**.  
- **Traits and Abilities** cost **1 point per dot**.  
- **Basic Gifts** cost **3 points each**.

## Character Sheet Changes

- You have **90 days** to make adjustments to your character sheet as part of character creation.
- After 90 days, **no further changes** may be made.
- You also have **90 days** to submit your **background** to claim **background points**.

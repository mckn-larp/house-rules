# Merits & Flaws: Garou & Fera Specific

-----
This section covers special traits that provide characters with advantages (**Merits**) or disadvantages (**Flaws**). These traits are designed to enhance roleplay and mechanical diversity.

---

## General Guidelines

- **Not all Merits and Flaws are allowed** in play. Please consult the **Storyteller (ST) staff** before selecting any.
- If you have a **Flaw that may impact gameplay**, inform STs at **the start of game**.
- This is **not an exhaustive list** — STs may approve additional Merits and Flaws at their discretion.
- **W20 Note**: Merits that were originally **tribal-specific** may be available as **generic** options. This **overrides** tribal exclusivity from prior editions.

> **Costs** are as listed in *Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th Anniversary Edition (W20)* unless otherwise stated.
